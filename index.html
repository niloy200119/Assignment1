                <p class="pillars-dsp">Dr. Yunus believes that "Bangladesh 2.0" should move beyond traditional business models that prioritize profit over people. Instead, he advocates for social business—businesses that solve social problems without aiming for personal profit. He envisions a world where wealth is shared equitably, and technology serves humanity rather than creating divides.
                He often says, "Poverty belongs in museums." For "Bangladesh 2.0," Dr. Yunus imagines a nation leading the charge in eradicating poverty, achieving zero unemployment, and addressing climate challenges innovatively. His vision inspires hope that with collective effort, Bangladesh can set an example for the rest of the world.</p>

Named after the nation's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It is a geostationary communications satellite designed to improve telecommunications, broadcasting, and internet services across the country, including remote and rural areas. The project signifies Bangladesh's entry into the elite space club and showcases its ambition in science and technology. Operated by the Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Limited (BCSCL), it also aids in disaster management and economic growth by fostering connectivity.</p>
